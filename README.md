## Introduction

[TianDian Daily](https://tdd.bunnyxt.com) is a personal project by bunnyxt designed to elevate the exchange of Vocaloid China-related data. Our goal is to offer comprehensive, easily accessible data and intuitive visualizations for all enthusiasts interested in Vocaloid China statistics.

The project is composed of three distinct components, all interconnected with a central database. These are:

- frontend: data presentation and interaction ([tdd-frontend](https://github.com/bunnyxt/tdd-frontend))
- backend: data access api ([tdd-backend](https://github.com/bunnyxt/tdd-backend))
- spider: original data collection（tdd-spider）

See the structure below.
